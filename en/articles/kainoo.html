                <p class="generalText" style="font-size: 1.2em;">During my internship at the Swiss company Kaïnoo, my
                    first project for them was a
                    web app for real estate tours and videoconferencing (both at the same time). It allows real estate
                    agents to easily show their properties, and customers to better imagine the final product than with
                    architects' blueprints. This project was made in Unity, and used Mirror for the "multiplayer" part
                    (the
                    fact of having several people in the same flat) and Agora for the videoconferencing part.<br>This
                    project was done in 3 steps. First, overall bugfixing and security
                    improvements (since each user can create a private room, we must guarantee that only those they gave
                    the
                    code to can access it). Then, the creation of the "onboarding website", which is the web page you
                    first
                    land on, and where you can set up your equipment before going into the webGL app. Finally, I added a
                    second scene, which would allow factory owners to visit their properties and better visualise their
                    floor plans when they want to change them. I had to create the code necessary to host and
                    differentiate
                    several scenes at once.<br>For the second half of this internship, I worked on a Unity package made
                    to create
                    and upload asset bundles onto a centralised database. Those bundles would be made in two versions :
                    a
                    low definition one, made to be downloaded first to allow the user to onboard quickly, and a high
                    definition one, to be downloaded in the background to give the user the best experience
                    (eventually).</p>
